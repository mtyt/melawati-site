# Introducing...
<p style="font-family:Melawati; font-size:40px">Oddity</p>

The Melawati Modular Oddity!

Take a trigger input signal, and send it to one of eight outputs randomly, depending on
the probability potmeters in three stages!
Two the power of three baby!
Additional features: re-assign the first stagen as a split instead of a choice, save
the last 16 outputs to memory, and load 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 16 in memory mode!
Temporarily disable memory mode or overwrite the memory!

This module has it all: LEDs, potentiometers and jacks!

## Pre-order now!
Currently preparing for mass production. Pre-order now by sending an email to...

## Nerdy tech-talk and specs:
- The input is zener-diode protected and will limit any incoming voltage to 0-5V.
- The outputs are protected by diodes in order to protect the internal circuits if you
mess up your patch and route outputs to outputs. Just in case.
- The signals are processes by a microcontroller. It doesn't have infinite speed so if you
start inputting signals with extremely high clock rates, things will get funky.
